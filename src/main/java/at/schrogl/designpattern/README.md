# Categories of Design Patterns

The GoF categorizes its design patterns into three types

## Creational Patterns

As their name reflects, creational patterns are used for creating objects. The main point of this kind of patterns is
to decouple the ability of creating objects from the need to know how to initialize these objects. Therefore creational
patterns provide means to programs for creating objects without the need to have a deeper understanding of these
objects.

Creational patterns can be further categorized into:

* **Class-based creational patterns**
These patterns use inheritance to create different types of objects.

* **Object-based creational patterns**
These patterns delegate the creation of a specific object to another object.

Creational patterns are especially important for programs that apply the **composition-over-inheritance** design
principle.
